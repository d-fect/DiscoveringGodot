# DiscoveringGodot
 For the Udemy course Discovering Godot by GameDev.tv

All games in the course are in this single repository, but each game exists in its separate sub-directory.

## Games
### HelloGodot
Not really a game. Just prints some things to the console in Godot.

### Loony_Lips
The game asks the player for some words and then inserts them into a story.

The stories included in my version of the game are really, really, REALLY bad, but that's why I chose to store them in a json-file. That way everyone can add their own stories, and preferably delete the ones already in there. :)

Just edit the StoryBook.json-file in any text editor and go to town. The syntax should be pretty self-explanatory.

### Hoppy Days (WIP)
A 2D platformer with a rabbit, some colourful graphics, a jolly tune or two and coins. Many, many coins.
