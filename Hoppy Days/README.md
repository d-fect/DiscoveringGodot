# godot3-todo
This is a TODO list dock for the Godot 3 game engine. It is the successor of [the 2.1 version](https://github.com/need12648430/godot-todo).

## Features:
* Supports `TODO`, `HACK`, `BUG`, `FIXME`, and `NOTE` tags out of the box.
* Double clicking any TODO will bring you right to it; built-in script? No problem. TODO buried 200 lines deep? It'll even bring you to the line.
* Uses Godot's `EditorFileSystem`, so TODO lists are updated on file save with no (additional) background polling required. Some naive caching is also used to speed things up further.
* Searchable/filterable by TODO contents, or filenames.
* If the script editor is open, it will only show TODOs in the active script so you can focus exclusively on what you're doing.
* Tight integation with the Godot 3 ~ **a e s t h e t i c** ~. (In other words I blatantly (and lazily) abused the built-in icons.)
